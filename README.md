Sentiment Analysis with Amazon Reviews
Amazon Reviews Dataset

This dataset contains several million reviews of Amazon products, with the reviews separated into two classes for positive and negative reviews.

This is a large dataset, and the version that I am using here only has the text as a feature with no other metadata. This makes this an interesting dataset for doing NLP work. It is data written by users, so it's like that there are various typos, nonstandard spellings, and other variations that you may not find in curated sets of published text.
